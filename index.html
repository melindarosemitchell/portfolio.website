            </h2>
            <p class="about"><strong> Final stages PhD student </strong> with a keen interest in the Biological Sciences. Working in collaboration with the <em> Unrecovered War Casualties-Army</em>, who assist in the recovery of fallen Australian soldiers, her PhD project
                aims to utilise Y-DNA, in particular Y-SNPs, to improve current methods for historical remains identification. Making use of a multigenerational pedigree, her research has applications outside historical work, including the resolution
                of cold cases and disaster victim identification cases.

            <p class="about"><u>PhD Title:</u> Investigation of Y-chromosomal markers for Historical Military Identifications <br>
                <u>Supervisory team:</u> Distinguished Professor Lyn Griffiths, Associate Professor Larisa Haupt, Dr Kirsty Wright.<br>
                <u>Brief project description:</u> Y-STR profiling of historical military remains often yields inconclusive results as, due to allelic dropout, profiles of individuals thought to be unrelated are identical. To resolve these common profiles,
                my project is investigating other Y-DNA markers (e.g. alternate Y-STR markers or Y-SNPs) for potential inclusion in the identification strategy. To this end, I have designed a custom Y-SNP panel; this panel has been practically evaluated
                using Agena MassARRAY (MALDI-TOF) to determine haplotypes of related individuals of the Norfolk Island population, followed by Sanger sequencing to confirm variants. For the second stage of my project, I was required to write an Ethics
                Application for review by the University’s Ethics Board (successful). This second stage utilises samples from individuals with common Y-STR profiles (currently used method in historical remains identification cases) to determine the capability
                of the custom Y-SNP panel to discriminate between them. This project has highlighted methods other than Y-SNPs that may also be viable alternatives to commonly used Y-STRs.
